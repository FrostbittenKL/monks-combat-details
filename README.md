# Monk's Combat Details
Add-On Module for Foundry VTT
A bunch of little things to make running combat a little easier.

## Installation
Simply use the install module screen within the FoundryVTT setup

## Usage & Current Features
### Turn notifications
Added turn notification for the player.  During combat the player will receive an alert notification when their turn is up next, and another one when it's their turn to move.  Either message or accompanying sound effects can be toggled.

### Combat Encounter Automation
When a combat is started, it will popout the Encounter Dialog and switch to the Chat Tab.

The popup will also close when the encounter has been finished.

1.0.15 When creating an encounter, enemy tokens are kept hidden from players until the combat is started, thereby giving the GM a chance to hide the tokens.

1.0.16 Automatically sets the defeated status when an NPC token reaches 0 HP.

1.0.17 Reveal initiative when changing a token from invisible to visible.

### Show Combat CR
Display the calculated CR of the Encounter.  This should give you a clue if the encounter might be scaled too hard for the current party.  Not 100% accurate but enough for a good idea.

### Combat tracker 1.0.14
Display an animated disc behind the token that currently has a turn in the encounter.

## Bug Reporting
I'm sure there are lots of issues with it.  It's very much a work in progress.
